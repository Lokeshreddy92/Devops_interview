      <div class="item item-text-wrap">
        We create images manually only, using with Docker<space> create<space> image-name along with I will pass server IP also.
Once we create that images then we will configure that image according to my requirement like whatever configuration of java and like git whatever I want we will configure that image we will push in to repository after that using by Docker build and publish plugin in Jenkins, we are using for just calling the image from Jenkins to Docker hub repository…
Ex: if I want to install some AWS AMI in to the cluster then we should write it inside Docker file only. That AMI version number, after that which version of java you are trying to install that we have to mention, after we have to maintenance we have to give the image ID of the your cluster after that when we trigger the job, automatically it will call the Docker file and it will access on the cluster.

    <span class="num">6</span>How you deploy those packages and what you use service for deploy?</div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Yes, we can automate and we do manually also. We are using the rundeck tool for deployment.That deployment tool rundeck we configured in Jenkins only. Sometimes Some deployments only we will do manually only, that we can like log in to server just we will copy the packages from the Jenkins we can do the manually. Or else we installed rundeck plugin in Jenkins only, just we will pass the parameters from the Jenkinsunder build is parameterized option, so, whatever environment I want to deploy that ip address I will pass from the test parameters in the Jenkins. So, rundeck UUID code I will create in the rundeck job, that UUID (unique universal identifier) code I will pass from the Jenkins only. That UUID code from Jenkins call to the rundeck, this action I will perform in the last stage in the build action. So, once build getting success after it will go and check the deployment phase, it will check the test server from the build other parameter option, then it will deploy the in to your text parameter.

    If any machine is goes down, we can’t deploy the package,for this scenario before when I am deploying we use health check monitoring tool for the server monitoring. So, in the tool what exactly we do we will monitor the server before we do deployment. Whether server is down or up, suppose anything goes to wrong the machine is down then if I do deployment then It will go and fail the deployment in to particular server. here what exactly I will troubleshoot is I will log in to that particular server then I will check whether the service is running or not and will check CPU utilization how much memory it is currently, once it is done, suppose the server is like it is related to CPU utilization what exactly I will do is I will take the backup of the old files in particular location and I will remove the files from the particular server after that I will start deployment like that I can troubleshoot.

    <span class="num">15</span>What is Docker?</div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Docker is a container management service. It is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.
    Docker has the ability to reduce the size of development by providing a smaller footprint of the operating system via containers.
    We can deploy Docker containers anywhere, on any physical and virtual machines and even on the cloud. Docker containers are pretty lightweight, they are very easily scalable.
    Docker Engine : It is used for building Docker images and creating Docker containers.
    Docker Hub : This is the registry which is used to host various Docker images.
    Docker Compose : This is used to define applications using multiple Docker containers.

Actually my developer will rise a requests in the service now, once they rise a request to service now, we will get the mails like ticket number, what exactly request number, then once I log in to the ticket number, I come to know, that is my first step
We have daily releases, weekly releases and monthly releases. For daily release we get minimum 3 or 4  releases , so that kind of I will take care and apart from this some days CI job creation request also will come and basically we are using the nexus tool for uploading the packages both manually and automatically , so such kind of things they will provide zip file or war file or package name they will give instead of that provide details where exactly they want to upload maven details,group id, artefact id and version according to that we will upload that and apart from this 2 or 3 requests will come from deployment side, so I will take care of the deployment side also, apart from this sometimes will get chance to go for the trainings and all like internal training we have, so sometimes I will attend that,  these kind of activities I do

QA environment tests for we have another team. There they will do the more testing and application. For automated test we integrate selenium test plug-in with Jenkins machines, that test cases provided by developers only, in the code they will write that one, that we integrated inside the Jenkins so automatically it will test the Selenium test case automatically.

    Yes, recently we implemented the DevOps overview for my project, as per requirement. So, basically it is a very big task, like complete environment infrastructure with in one second only we have to automating in the single job in Jenkins, what and all steps it will perform,
First step, once my developer will checked in the code, automatically it will pick the changes, after that it will check the code quality, it will go to build face, then it will go to release face, after that it will upload the packages in to satellite server, so from next thing once it is done after that it will go to upload packages in to nexus also, and finally once it is done deployment also perform automatically. This complete architecture we implementing in the jobs in Jenkins environment. I mean for client visit, we implemented this process after that client gave the approval for implementing the same thing into current project also. So, this complete work nearly 2months time took for me, for implementing these things. In this scenario such issues I have faced like related to compatibility issues and related to code issue and each everything it’s like a challenging work only, so, sometimes I worked with developer and sometimes I sit alone to work, so many things we automated in this concept, so now basically before doing this we are doing manually work and releases and all. Nowwe automated each and everything, once developer checked the code, automatically it will perform the all activity. So, this is my very big challenging work.

  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    a security group control the inbound traffic that's allowed to reach the instances that are associated with the security group and the outbound traffic that's allowed to leave them.
•	By default, security groups allow all outbound traffic.
•	You can't change the outbound rules for an EC2-Classic security group.
•	Security group rules are always permissive; you can't create rules that deny access.
•	Security groups are stateful — if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of inbound security group rules. For VPC security groups, this also means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules.

Security group we create whenever we launching the instances, and whenever we create your users in the IIM there first we will check the what and all permissions that particular user having and then that particular user you can configure in to your security group, so  what kind of like. Your security group you will add in to that particular user in the group session, later it will go to next stage. So, this purpose we are using, these are access management things.

  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Branch is nothing but whenever you are doing the development and starting initial stage whenever the developer develop the source code in particular branching so, likewe have different branches like devbranches, bug fix branches, hotfix branches, these are based the requirement. Suppose consider me I am working on development, complete development I will do build in the branches, once it is done I will rise a request to create continues integrations to the job then I can build the code that is the branching.
Coming to tag, so our Jenkins job getting success every release we are taking backup for the future reference, so whenever issue is happening in the particular version in future reference I will back up for future things, suppose anything issues happen I don’t want to touch my code in the branches I will take only from tag. So, we are using the tags for taking the backup purpose, this is the main difference between the branch and tag. So usually in the branching we have different strategies we are following, so in my organization we are using branch, tag, trunk strategies we are using.  So, main development we are going to do in trunk and branches is nothing but we are maintaining the original source code.

    For that situation I will install build pipeline plug in Jenkins,let us consider 3 branches I have like example1, example2, example3 branches I have. So what I will do, my developer will develop the source code in three branches, so meanwhile what I will do, I install the pipeline plugin in to my jenkins dashboard later I create 3 different jobs, like ci-src-example1, ci- src-example2 I will create 2 jobs, what I will do is I will integrate that 3 branches to 3 different jobs, next I will go to particular configuration there I go to post build action, build parameterized on other project option is there, there I will give the suppose the example1 job open example2 name I configure in to example1 job, similarly I will configure example3 job in example2 job.
Once it is done, when you refresh this job when it looks like it is
If you pen the example1 it will show the downstream job as the example2
And if you go to example2 job there you refresh the job you can see upstream project is example1 and downstream project is example3
After that if you open example3 job just refresh it you can see upstream is example2 job only.
Once my configuration is done in pipeline process, exactly what I do is I will configure pipeline view, so in that I select the initial option where I want to do start the building. In that situation I will configure the job name example1 if I want to start first branch, then I will give that only. After I save the build pipeline view, finally once check in the source code automatically 3jobs will trigger whatever you configured. This is the concept I choose to pipeline view.

    <span class="num">45</span>How many types of source control tools are there and what is difference between them?</div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    We have cvs, svn and Git tools for source control tools, apart from this I worked purely on svn, recently I started career in Git also. In svn we are following different branching strategies, so how we will work on is follow different strategies like branch, tag, trunk we will create in repository.
In trunk we are maintaining original source code of the particular version, according to developer requirement we are creating the branches like development branch, bug fix branch, sometimes developer will tell me to create temporary branches like hotfix branches, so then I will create temporary branches also,
Coming to purpose of the tags is we are taking back up of the future releases purpose if anything issues are happen in to my revision, I will take the back up in to my tags folder in t svn. (Once Jenkins jobs getting success then I will take the backup of the particular version)
I can’t review the code before Commit in to svn, but in Git we can review the code. In git we use merge option from branch to branch and sometimes we use merge revision number to revision number like 1600 to 2000 and sometimes we are using merge folder to folder also.

    <span class="num">46</span>Why do we need branching, why do we do?</div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Yes, while development stage, we will create the standard branching for different different requirement. So usually in development stage suppose, already u have developed some version, you were released that version in to your jenkins, later may be after releasing the particular version to the customer, then may be issue will happen in 2 or 3 months, in that scenario no need to go to standard branch and all, so what we are doing is we will create the separate branches for only fixing the issues of the particular version. Suppose we got the error in version 1.0 what I will do is that standard branch only I will create one more branch like bugfix branch, in that I will check out source code from standard branch, I will fix and then I will release package to the customer. So this is one scenario,
Suppose one version I released recently, it is under the testing, if I want to add something little bit code to that existing version, in that scenario what I have to do then I will create the separate branch for the temporary storage purpose, fix branch I will create in the branches.
Once my activity is done, I will delete the particular branch. So these kind of scenarios I will use the branching.

    <span class="num">47</span>Which one did u like Git or svn, explain it?</div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Recently I started Git, Compare to Git I like Git, because there is no branching strategy, directly we will interact with master only,  we will create in master branch only, we will pull the code and all this kind of activities.
I can’t review the code before Commit in to svn, but in Git we can review the code. In git we use merge option from branch to branch and sometimes we use merge revision number to revision number like 1600 to 2000 and sometimes we are using merge folder to folder also.

  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Usually maven life cycle is whenever we are in development stage once my development is done what I will do is I will complete building purpose I will use maven. In life cycle we have different different stages like when we development stage to and then complete deployment stage we have a particular stages.
First stage is validate, whenever we develop the source code then it will validate the complete code, once it is validated after it will go to compile stage (MVN<>compiler), after compiling the source code what we have to do is it will test that code after it is done then it will go to packaging stage (MVN<>Package) like it will packaging the source code after that once packaging done then it will go to verifying the package. After that if I want to install the packages then I can use the install next stage. Once install is done it will go directly to deployment (MVN(space)Deploy). So this is complete step by step the complete maven life cycle.

    <span class="num">50</span>If I want to schedule a job in Jenkins, how many ways you do?</div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    We can do in two ways, whenever our developer wants to check in the source code in to svn, if you want to automate the process, what you have to do is we use poll SCM in Jenkins. For schedule the job purpose We give crone format in poll SCM in jenkins, according to my requirement checked in the source code in to my svn repository if I want to build next second only, what I will do is I will give the poll SCM tag like five stars, then whenever source code check in to svn repository automatically It will trigger the build. Based up on that requirement I will change the crone in to poll SCM in Jenkins, the same way
If I want to use the build periodically for schedule job is there in Jenkins, so how it will work is  if you didn’t change the code in to svn repository, automatically build need to be trigger this also based up on the requirement we use this option. So two ways we can pass the option.

  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Usually whenever we want to create instance first step we have to like let us know which environment we want to create like Linux environment or windows environment, based on this we have to create.
We required the location where exactly we want to create, based up on these two things what we will do is we will go to EC2 service, then launch the EC2 instances which I have to create,  later security groups we have to provide as per requirement in to our environment.
When we are creating the instances we have to select VPC also which public IP you want to select, that also you have to enable the public stage after that if I want to activate the tags also like sshp rules if I want to pass I will pass the rules also. Later once it is done I will select the my PPK file in to my instances later I will launch the instance, once I launch instances I have to log in to particular instances, this is the like Linux configuration
If I want to create the windows environment based up on the requirement we have to select windows instances in the EC2 instances.

  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Actually I never worked on this activity, but I have knowledge on this
First step we have to take the backup of the particular which instance you want to upgrade in to next level, so first AMI we have to backup in to particular poll instance after that you can upgrade in to latest version of the your instance.

    <span class="num">53</span>How much IOU involved in customized Docker images?</div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    What exactly I do whenever the developer create Docker file they will keep the file in to M2 repository, I will push the code from maven to Jenkins and the image I will build then I will upload the image in to ECS. That configuration I did in the Docker. In the senesce like AWS we integrated with Jenkins.

    <span class="num">54</span>Are you involved pulling the images and uploading in to diff servers and setting up the images configuration creation?</div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Sometimes I will only configure the image file, Docker file also I can create. Instead of the Master slave configuration in Jenkins, we are using to the Docker image to configure the servers like we are using the deployment tool rundeck, so we configure rundeck inside the Docker image only, first that image we configure inside the Jenkins, so whenever we require the deployment that image we are calling from the Jenkins using the Docker build and publish plugin. According to the details whatever repository I am using in the Docker that details we   pass from the Jenkins only, so like that requirement I worked.

  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Basically cloud requirement is my developer will rise a requirements to create EC2 infrastructure using Terraform. I mean with details provided by developer only. According to that I will write Terraform script, in the Terraform script what and all requirements they require like instances type and availability zone and security group and AMI and everything should pass from Terraform only, if you run the Terraform script automatically that instance will create, once I created that instance, what the developer will do is they will use instances for their requirement, they will check in to source code in to particular instances, after that according to my requirement whatever  code they develop, ECS service we are using Docker file, so this code and Docker file we will set up in to my Jenkins machine only, so what exactly we do is maven we are using the build tool, whatever slave machine we are using in the Jenkins, whatever code we have that developer develop that we will keep inside the .m2 repository. After that what exactly I will do is that Git repository we are using version controlling as Git, that URL I should pass from the Jenkins only, then trigger the build.

  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
    Sequential only, we are using the pipeline method for each and every job, so we integrate the according to the pipeline structure, so one job is created for the build, after that it will go to deployment, finally it will go to test environment. So these three pipeline I have been configured.
